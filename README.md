tally-rel-majoritarian
======================

Code used to select items based on ranking (no-ties) or "Do Not Want" referendum

Goal
----
To allow voters to rank items that would be spent with a surplus budget. Not all items could be purchased with the budget so this method was created in an effort to mimic a round-table discussion. That is, generally each person has some idea on how things ought to be spent within the budget constraints and if their first choice cannot be met by the popular vote, they would shift to their next favoured item. This tallying method tooking in every votes rankings (voters could only select one first choice, one second choice..etc--hence no ties) and calcuated the a items with more than 50% of the popular vote.
